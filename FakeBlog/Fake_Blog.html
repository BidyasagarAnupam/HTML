          <h2>Club PORTFOLIO</h2>
          <p>Manchester United is my favorite soccer club. They have won a record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups, 5 League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields. The club has also won three UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA Europa League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. In 1998–99, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the treble of the Premier League, the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League.[3] In 2016–17, by winning the UEFA Europa League, they became one of five clubs to have won all three main UEFA club competitions. In addition, they became the only professional English club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association..</p>
          <h2>Rank</h2>
          <p>Manchester United was the highest-earning football club in the world for 2015–16, with an annual revenue of €689 million,[7] and the world's most valuable football club in 2017, valued at £2.86 billion.[8] As of June 2015, it is the world's most valuable football brand, estimated to be worth $1.2 billion.[9][10] After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost £800 million, after which the company was taken private again, before going public once more in August 2012, when they made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Manchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world,[11][12] and has its strongest rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City and Leeds United..</p>
